# Bug Fix Summary - Version 2.0.0

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue Reported
**Problem:** After saving custom validation messages from the admin panel:
1. Fields showed blank when reopening the form editor
2. Custom messages were not displaying on frontend form submissions

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Contact Form 7 Version Compatibility Issue

**Problem:**
Different versions of Contact Form 7 use different methods to access the form ID:
- Newer versions: `$contact_form->id()` (method)
- Older versions: `$contact_form->id` (property)

Our code only supported the method approach, causing failures on some CF7 versions.

**Location:** 
- `admin/class-cf7-custom-messages-admin.php` (line 227)
- `includes/class-cf7-custom-messages-validator.php` (line 54)

### 2. Save Logic Issue

**Problem:**
The save function was only storing non-empty messages, which prevented:
- Proper message clearing when users deleted text
- Accurate tracking of which fields had been configured

**Location:**
- `admin/class-cf7-custom-messages-admin.php` (line 219-222)

---

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Universal CF7 Compatibility

**Before:**
```php
$custom_messages = get_post_meta( $contact_form->id(), '_cf7_custom_validation_messages', true );
```

**After:**
```php
// Get form ID - handle both method and property access
$form_id = null;
if ( method_exists( $contact_form, 'id' ) ) {
    $form_id = $contact_form->id();
} elseif ( isset( $contact_form->id ) ) {
    $form_id = $contact_form->id;
}

if ( ! $form_id ) {
    return;
}

$custom_messages = get_post_meta( $form_id, '_cf7_custom_validation_messages', true );
```

**Benefit:** Now works with all Contact Form 7 versions

### Fix 2: Improved Save Logic

**Before:**
```php
// Only save non-empty messages
if ( ! empty( $message ) ) {
    $custom_messages[ $field_name ] = $message;
}
```

**After:**
```php
// Save all messages, including empty ones (to allow clearing)
$custom_messages[ $field_name ] = $message;
```

**Benefit:** Users can now clear messages by deleting text and saving

### Fix 3: Better Error Handling

**Added:**
- Null checks for form ID before proceeding
- Method existence checks before calling methods
- Property existence checks before accessing properties

**Benefit:** Plugin fails gracefully instead of causing PHP errors

## Upgrade Instructions

### For Users Experiencing the Bug

**Option 1: Simple Update**
1. Download version 2.0.0
2. Deactivate the old plugin
3. Delete the old plugin folder
4. Upload the new version
5. Activate the plugin
6. Re-enter your custom messages (if they were lost)

**Option 2: Git Update**
```bash
cd /path/to/wp-content/plugins/cf7-custom-validation-messages
git pull origin main
```

**Option 3: Manual File Update**
Replace these two files with the new versions:

- `includes/class-cf7-custom-messages-validator.php`

### Important Note
Your custom messages are stored in the database, so they won't be lost during plugin update. However, if the bug prevented them from saving initially, you'll need to re-enter them after updating.
